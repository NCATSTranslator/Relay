## This example configuration file demonstrates various settings
## available via rabbitmq.conf. It primarily focuses core broker settings
## but some tier 1 plugin settings are also covered.

# ======================================
# Core broker section
# ======================================

## Networking
## Maximum amount of time allowed for the AMQP 0-9-1 and AMQP 1.0 handshake
## (performed after socket connection and TLS handshake) to complete, in milliseconds.
##
handshake_timeout = 10000

loopback_users.guest = false

## Set the server AMQP 0-9-1 heartbeat timeout in seconds.
## RabbitMQ nodes will send heartbeat frames at roughly
## the (timeout / 2) interval. Two missed heartbeats from
## a client will close its connection.
##
## Values lower than 6 seconds are very likely to produce
## false positives and are not recommended.

heartbeat = 30

## Consumer timeout
## If a message delivered to a consumer has not been acknowledge before this timer
## triggers the channel will be force closed by the broker. This ensure that
## faultly consumers that never ack will not hold on to messages indefinitely.
##
consumer_timeout = 36000000

## HTTP listener and embedded Web server settings.
# ## See https://rabbitmq.com/management.html for details.

## Number of Erlang processes that will accept connections for the TCP
## and TLS listeners.
